<h3>Storage and Shelf Life</h3>
<p>Harrison's is committed to protecting your bird from artificial preservatives. Here are some suggestions to keep your food fresh without preservatives:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Squeeze all air out of the bag and zip it shut at the top.</li>
    <li>If the zip lock gets removed or damaged, fold the top over several times and close with a clip.</li>
    <li>Keep food in original bag. Do not repackage into plastic bags or containers.</li>
    <li>Use contents within 8 weeks of opening bag.</li>
    <li>Purchase Harrison's foods only in their original packaging.</li>
    <li>Refrigeration or freezing after opening may help maintain freshness.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Converting to Harrison's</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Consult with an avian veterinarian before any diet change and annually thereafter.</li>
    <li>Mix Harrison's with your bird's current diet and note acceptance.</li>
    <li>If your bird needs more time, taper amount given over four weeks, increasing Harrison's by 25% each week (reducing other food by 25%) until you can safely remove the previous food altogether.</li>
    <li>If needed, scatter Harrison'snuggets over white paper or a mirror on the floor of the enclosure.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Daily Feeding Directions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Feed fresh food daily.</li>
    <li>To help reduce waste, feed as distinct meals.</li>
    <li>Birds may eat all they want but use the table below as a guideline.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Foods</h3>
<p>A bird's daily diet should be 75-80% Harrison's Bird Foods, 15-20% organic dark green leafy or dark yellow meaty vegetables and fruits (including sweet potatoes, carrots, pumpkin, winter squash, broccoli, parsley, spinach, mango or papaya) and 5% omega-rich seeds and nuts (flax, chia, perilla, or JumpStart Omega). Do not offer vitamins unless directed by your avian veterinarian. Do not use other formulated diets in conjunction with Harrison's or you could reduce the benefits. Harrison's ingredients are not processed in a manner that destroys naturally occurring seasonal characteristics. Variations in color, texture and nugget size may result and are normal.</p>
